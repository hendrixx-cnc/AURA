## Risk Mitigation

### Prior Art Search (CRITICAL)

**Why**: Discover conflicting patents before investing in non-provisional

**Cost**: $5K-$15K

**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks

**What to Search**:
- Compression + metadata systems
- AI communication protocols
- Template-based compression
- Conversation acceleration
- Audit logging architectures

**Expected Result**: No blocking prior art found (high confidence)

### Patent Attorney Review

**Why**: Strengthen claims, improve grant probability

**Cost**: $5K-$10K

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks

**What They'll Do**:
- Review all 35 claims
- Suggest claim language improvements
