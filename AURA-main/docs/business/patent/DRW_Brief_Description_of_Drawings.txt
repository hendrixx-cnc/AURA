BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

FIG. 1 depicts the container format structure showing the magic header, version byte, length fields, frequency table, metadata entries, and rANS bitstream.

FIG. 2 illustrates the tokenization pipeline showing dictionary phase, LZ77 phase, and safety check components.

FIG. 3 shows the rANS compression stage process flow including frequency counting, normalization, and encoding.

FIG. 4 depicts the metadata-driven fast path architecture enabling processing without full decompression.

FIG. 5 illustrates the server architecture showing compression, network transmission, mandatory decompression, audit logging, and business logic flow.

FIG. 6 shows the template discovery and promotion pipeline including audit log replay, statistical analysis, scoring, and promotion workflow.

FIG. 7 depicts the streaming harness architecture for concurrent conversation testing and metrics collection.

FIG. 8 illustrates the separated audit architecture showing regulatory audit logs, AI alignment logs, metadata analytics, and safety alert logs.

FIG. 9 shows the adaptive conversation acceleration process demonstrating pattern learning and progressive latency reduction.

FIG. 10 depicts the compression method selection decision tree showing template matching, LZ77, semantic compression, and Brotli fallback paths.
