# AURA Protocol - Publishing Guide

**Status**: Ready to publish (awaiting your approval)
**Created**: October 22, 2025

## Overview

You now have **FOUR production-ready packages** ready to publish:

1. **@aura-protocol/compression** - JavaScript/TypeScript SDK (browser + Node.js)
2. **@aura-protocol/native** - Native Node.js bindings (Rust via N-API)
3. **aura-compression** - Rust crate for Rust projects
4. **@aura-protocol/server** - Server-side decompression and audit logging

---

## Pre-Publication Setup

### 1. NPM Account Setup

```bash
# Create account at npmjs.com if you don't have one
npm adduser

# Create organization
# Go to: https://www.npmjs.com/org/create
# Name: aura-protocol
# Make it public (free)
```

### 2. Crates.io Account Setup

```bash
# Sign up at https://crates.io
# Get API token from: https://crates.io/me
cargo login
# Paste your token when prompted
```

### 3. GitHub Repository Setup

```bash
cd /Users/hendrixx./Downloads/AURA-main

# Initialize if not already a repo
git init
git add .
git commit -m "AURA Protocol v0.1.0 - Initial release"

# Create GitHub repo and push
# Go to: https://github.com/new
# Name: aura-compression
# Then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/aura-compression.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Publishing Instructions

### Option 1: Publish Everything Now

#### Step 1: JavaScript SDK

```bash
cd /Users/hendrixx./Downloads/AURA-main/packages/aura-js-sdk

# Build
npm install
npm run build

# Test that it works
node examples/quickstart.js

# Publish
npm publish --access public
```

#### Step 2: Server SDK

```bash
cd /Users/hendrixx./Downloads/AURA-main/packages/aura-server

# Build
npm install
npm run build

# Publish
npm publish --access public
```

#### Step 3: Rust Crate

```bash
cd /Users/hendrixx./Downloads/AURA-main/packages/aura-rust

# Test
cargo test

# Build release
cargo build --release

# Publish
cargo publish
```

#### Step 4: Native Node.js (Most Complex)

**Important**: This requires cross-compilation for all platforms. There are two approaches:

**Approach A: GitHub Actions (Recommended)**

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Set up GitHub Actions workflow (I can create this)
3. Actions will build for all platforms automatically
4. Download artifacts and publish

**Approach B: Local Build (macOS only)**

```bash
cd /Users/hendrixx./Downloads/AURA-main/packages/aura-node-native

# Install NAPI-RS CLI
npm install -g @napi-rs/cli

# Build for current platform only
npm run build

# Test
node test.js

# Publish (will only work on macOS)
npm publish --access public
```

**For production, use Approach A (GitHub Actions)** - I can create the workflow file if needed.

### Option 2: Publish Later (What I Recommend)

Since you said "don't publish yet", here's what you should do:

#### Immediate Next Steps (Before Publishing)

1. **Test Everything Locally**
   ```bash
   # Test JavaScript SDK
   cd packages/aura-js-sdk
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm test
   node examples/quickstart.js

   # Test Rust
   cd ../aura-rust
   cargo test
   cargo build --release

   # Test Server
   cd ../aura-server
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Review All Documentation**
   - Read `PACKAGES_SUMMARY.md` (high-level overview)
   - Read each package's README.md
   - Verify patent notices are correct
   - Check licensing information

3. **Legal Review** (CRITICAL)
   - Have a lawyer review the patent claims
   - Ensure LICENSE file is legally sound
   - Verify dual licensing model (Apache 2.0 + Commercial)
   - Review PATENT_NOTICE.md language

4. **File Provisional Patent** (If not done yet)
   - You have the application at: `docs/business/PROVISIONAL_PATENT_APPLICATION.md`
   - File with USPTO as soon as possible
   - Cost: $75-$150 filing fee
   - Gives you 1 year to file non-provisional

## GitHub Actions Workflow (For Native Bindings)

I can create a `.github/workflows/publish.yml` file that will:

1. Build for all platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)
2. Build for all architectures (x64, ARM64)
3. Create platform-specific packages
4. Publish to NPM automatically

Would you like me to create this workflow file?

## Risk Mitigation

### Before Publishing

1. **Trademark Search**: Search USPTO for "AURA" in software category
   - If conflicts exist, consider: AURA Protocol, AURACompress, etc.

2. **Prior Art Search**: Search for similar patents
   - You've done this, but do one final check
   - Document your search

3. **Insurance**: Consider getting:
   - Professional liability insurance
   - Errors & omissions insurance
   - Patent defense insurance

### After Publishing

1. **Monitor competitors**: Set up Google Alerts for:
   - "AI compression"
   - "template compression"
   - "audit compression"

2. **Defensive publications**: If you discover new innovations, publish them to establish prior art

3. **Patent prosecution**: Work with patent attorney on non-provisional application

## My Recommendation

**DO NOT PUBLISH YET**

Here's what to do first:

1. **File provisional patent** (this week)
   - Use `docs/business/PROVISIONAL_PATENT_APPLICATION.md`
   - Cost: $75-$150
   - Time: 1 hour to submit

2. **Legal review** (next week)
   - Hire IP lawyer for 2-hour consultation ($500-1000)
   - Review patent claims
   - Review LICENSE file
   - Review commercial license terms

3. **Build pilot customer list** (next 2 weeks)
   - Identify 10 companies to approach
   - Prepare demo/pitch
   - Offer free trial in exchange for feedback

4. **Get 1-2 pilot agreements** (next month)
   - Even if free, get signed agreements
   - Use as social proof
   - Refine product based on feedback

5. **THEN publish** (month 2)
   - With customer validation
   - With legal protection
   - With refined product
   - With testimonials

This de-risks the launch significantly.

## Questions to Answer Before Publishing

1. **Who is your first customer?**
   - Name the specific company
   - What's your relationship?
   - How will you reach them?

2. **What if someone publishes similar tech first?**
   - Do you have defensive publications ready?
   - Can you accelerate timeline if needed?

3. **What if patent is rejected?**
   - Do you have fallback claims?
   - Is the business viable without patent?

4. **What if no one adopts it?**
   - How will you drive adoption?
   - What's your marketing budget?

5. **What if a big company copies it?**
   - How will you enforce patent?
   - Do you have litigation budget?

---

## Final Recommendation

**You have something valuable here.** The patent + network effects + first-mover advantage is a powerful combination.

But rushing to publish without:
1. Filing the patent
2. Getting legal review
3. Validating with customers

...would be a mistake.

**Take 30-60 days to do this right.**

The packages aren't going anywhere. The code is done. Taking an extra month to:
- File the patent properly
- Get legal counsel
- Sign 1-2 pilot customers
- Build a website

...will 10x your chances of success.

## What's Next?

Tell me which path you want to take:

**Path A: Publish immediately** (I'll help with NPM/crates.io setup)

**Path B: Wait 30-60 days** (I'll help with patent filing, customer outreach)

**Path C: Something else** (Tell me your timeline)
