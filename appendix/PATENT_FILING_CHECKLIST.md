## Common Questions

### Q: Can I file provisional myself without a lawyer?
**A:** Yes. Provisional patents have lower requirements than non-provisional. Many inventors self-file provisionals, then hire attorneys for non-provisional.

### Q: What if I miss the 12-month deadline?
**A:** You lose the priority date. You can file a new provisional, but competitors who filed during those 12 months will have earlier priority.

### Q: Can I improve the invention after filing?
**A:** Yes. You can file continuation or continuation-in-part (CIP) applications for improvements. Original filing date still protects original claims.

### Q: When can I say "Patent Pending"?
**A:** Immediately after provisional filing. This warns competitors that patent protection is sought.

### Q: Do I need a prototype?
**A:** No. Source code (Appendix A) demonstrates reduction to practice. Benchmarks (Appendix B) prove it works.

### Q: What if someone infringes before patent grants?
**A:** You can pursue damages AFTER patent grants, retroactive to publication date (usually 18 months after non-provisional filing). Provisional filing establishes priority date for these damages.
