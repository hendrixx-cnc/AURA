## Template Library Overview

The AURA template library contains pre-defined patterns for common AI response
types. Each template is assigned a unique ID and contains variable slots
marked with `{0}`, `{1}`, etc.

**Current Library Size:** 20 templates across 13 categories
**Expandable:** Yes (custom templates supported)
**IDs Reserved:** 0-255 (1 byte), 256-65535 (2 bytes extended)

## Binary Encoding Format

### Format Specification

```
Binary Semantic Compression Format (BSCF v1.0)

[Method Marker: 1 byte]
  0x00 = Binary Semantic
  0x01 = Brotli
  0xFF = Uncompressed

[Template ID: 1-2 bytes]
  0-127: Single byte (0x00-0x7F)
  128-255: Single byte (0x80-0xFF)
  256+: Two bytes (0x80 0x00 - 0xFF 0xFF)

[Slot Count: 1 byte]
  Number of variable slots (0-255)

[For each slot:]
  [Slot Length: 2 bytes] (big-endian uint16)
  [Slot Data: variable length] (UTF-8 encoded)
```

### Encoding Examples

**Example 1: Simple template (ID 11, 2 slots)**
```
Template: "{0} is {1}."
Text: "Python is a programming language."
Slots: ["Python", "a programming language"]

Binary encoding:
  Method marker: 0x00 (binary semantic)
  Template ID:   0x0B (11)
  Slot count:    0x02 (2 slots)
  Slot 0 length: 0x0006 (6 bytes)
  Slot 0 data:   "Python" (0x50 0x79 0x74 0x68 0x6F 0x6E)
  Slot 1 length: 0x0016 (22 bytes)
  Slot 1 data:   "a programming language" (22 UTF-8 bytes)

Total: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 22 = 35 bytes
Original: 33 bytes (text only, no template encoding)

Note: In this case, binary semantic is worse due to overhead.
      AURA would automatically select Brotli instead.
```

**Example 2: Static template (ID 100, 1 slot)**
```
Template: "Yes, I can help with that. What specific {0} would you like to know more about?"
Text: "Yes, I can help with that. What specific topic would you like to know more about?"
Slots: ["topic"]

Binary encoding:
  Method marker: 0x00 (binary semantic)
  Template ID:   0x64 (100)
  Slot count:    0x01 (1 slot)
  Slot 0 length: 0x0005 (5 bytes)
  Slot 0 data:   "topic" (0x74 0x6F 0x70 0x69 0x63)

Total: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 10 bytes
Original: 81 bytes

Compression ratio: 8.10:1 ✅
```

## Template Expansion Examples

### Example 1: Factual Response

**Input Template ID:** 10
**Slots:** ["capital", "France", "Paris"]
**Template:** `The {0} of {1} is {2}.`
**Output:** "The capital of France is Paris."

**Compression:**
- Original: 31 bytes
- Compressed: 7 bytes (template) + 19 bytes (slots) = 26 bytes
- Ratio: 1.19:1

### Example 2: Code Example

**Input Template ID:** 31
**Slots:** ["define a function", "python", "def hello():\n    print('Hello')"]
**Template:** `Here's how to {0}:\n\n\`\`\`{1}\n{2}\n\`\`\``
**Output:** "Here's how to define a function:\n\n```python\ndef hello():\n    print('Hello')\n```"

**Compression:**
- Original: 82 bytes
- Compressed: 7 bytes (template) + 54 bytes (slots) = 61 bytes

**Slots:** ["topic"]
**Template:** `Yes, I can help with that. What specific {0} would you like to know more about?`
**Output:** "Yes, I can help with that. What specific topic would you like to know more about?"

**Compression:**
- Original: 81 bytes
- Compressed: 3 bytes (template) + 7 bytes (slot) = 10 bytes
- Ratio: **8.10:1** ✅

## Template Design Guidelines

### Best Practices

1. **Keep templates generic** - Maximize reusability
2. **Minimize slot count** - Each slot adds 2+ bytes overhead
3. **Use static text** - More static text = better compression
4. **Avoid code in templates** - Code is too variable to template
5. **Test compression ratio** - Ensure template provides >2:1 compression

### Anti-Patterns

❌ **Too many slots:** `{0} {1} {2} {3} {4}` (10+ bytes overhead)
❌ **Too specific:** `In Python version 3.10, the function...` (low reuse)
❌ **Variable code:** Template with code snippets (code varies too much)
❌ **Very short templates:** `{0} is {1}` with long slots (overhead > savings)
