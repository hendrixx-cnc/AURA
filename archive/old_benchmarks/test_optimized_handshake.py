The transformer architecture utilizes self-attention mechanisms for natural language processing tasks. Deep learning models require extensive hyperparameter tuning including learning rate optimization, batch normalization, and dropout regularization. Convolutional neural networks excel at computer vision while recurrent networks handle sequential data.
