## 1. When is a Commercial License Required?

A commercial license is required under either of the following conditions:

1.  Your for-profit company, and any parent or subsidiary companies, have a combined annual gross revenue exceeding **$5 million USD**.
2.  You wish to use the AURA software in a proprietary (closed-source) application and cannot comply with the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3).

This model allows free use for students, hobbyists, academic researchers, non-profits, and small businesses, while requiring that larger commercial entities who derive value from AURA contribute to its development and maintenance.

## 2. Purchasing a License

There is a single commercial license for all qualifying entities. To purchase a license or to discuss the specific needs of your organization, please contact us.
