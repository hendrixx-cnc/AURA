# PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION
## AURA: ADAPTIVE UNIVERSAL RESPONSE AUDIT PROTOCOL

**Inventor**: Todd Hendricks  
**Filing Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Title**: System and Method for Auditable Multi-Layer Compression with Metadata Side-Channel for AI Communications

---

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to data compression, telemetry, and auditing systems for machine-generated communications. More particularly, it concerns techniques for compressing conversational traffic produced by artificial intelligence (AI) systems while guaranteeing (i) deterministic lossless reconstruction suitable for regulatory audits, (ii) structured metadata that downstream automated agents can consume directly, and (iii) automatic evolution of the compression corpus through discovery of emergent response templates.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### The Rise of Auditable AI Traffic

As enterprises deploy AI assistants and multi-agent orchestration platforms, they are required to maintain detailed, human-readable transcripts for compliance programs (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2) and for internal observability. Traditional text pipelines either:

1. **Store plaintext** – preserving readability but imposing high bandwidth/cost, or
2. **Use opaque compression (gzip/Brotli)** – lowering bandwidth at the expense of auditability because logs become binary blobs.

### Performance Pressure

In high-volume environments, every message often triggers a chain of downstream decisions (policy checks, caching, escalations). If each decision requires fully decompressing and parsing the text, overall CPU usage balloons. Prior art provides either template substitution or generic compression, but not both simultaneously with structured side information.

### Gaps in Prior Art

- Lack of hybrid codecs that mix semantic template substitution with general-purpose compression while maintaining human-readable logs.
- No standard way to surface *structured metadata* alongside the compressed payload so downstream automated systems can act without unfolding the entire transcript.
- Absence of adaptive mechanisms that keep the template library fresh as agents learn new phrasing.
- Limited solutions for AI-to-AI traffic, which proves substantially more compressible than human-to-AI exchanges but requires specialized handling.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention (hereafter **AURA**) introduces a multi-layer transport format with the following pillars:

1. **Semantic Layer** – Response templates and dictionary snippets are mapped to compact identifiers; unmatched spans are processed by a rolling LZ77 engine.
2. **Entropy Layer** – Tokens are entropy-coded with an order-0 range Asymmetric Numeral System (rANS) compressor producing a side-by-side metadata track.
3. **Metadata Side-Channel** – Each encoded token has optional metadata tuples recording template IDs, slot indexes, literal spans, match lengths, safety tags, and routing hints. Downstream logic can interpret these hints without reconstructing the underlying text.
4. **Audit Enforcement Layer** – Servers *must* convert received payloads back to plaintext before any business logic executes; the plaintext, encoded payload, and metadata are all logged for compliance.
5. **Adaptive Template Discovery** – A discovery engine continuously mines audit logs for new response patterns via statistical algorithms (n-gram mining, clustering, regex inference, prefix/suffix extraction). Only candidates with provable compression advantage and safety clearance are promoted.
6. **Streaming Harness & Benchmarking** – A reference load-test creates dozens of concurrent human-AI and AI-AI sessions, measures latency and CPU usage, and validates metadata-only pathways.
7. **Never-Worse Guarantee** – Any block that fails to compress below the original length is flagged as “uncompressed,” guaranteeing the wire payload never exceeds the source message.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

### 1. Architecture Overview

```
Client        →  AURA Encoder (templates + LZ77 + rANS + metadata)
Network       →  Payload {header, metadata, bitstream}
Server        →  AURA Decoder → Plaintext → Audit Log
                → Metadata Stream → Fast-path Decision Engine
                → Business Logic → AURA Encoder → Outgoing response
```

The client may be a browser, mobile app, IoT device, or autonomous agent. The server is the compliance boundary—plaintext is logged and available to auditors; metadata is optionally consumed by automation subsystems.

### 2. Container Format

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Magic (4 bytes)              = "AURA"                        │
│ Version (1 byte)             = 0x01                          │
│ Plain Token Length (4 bytes) = N                             │
│ rANS Payload Length (4 bytes)= M                             │
│ Metadata Entry Count (2)     = K                             │
│ Frequency Table (256 × 2)    = per-symbol frequencies        │
│ Metadata Entries (K × 6)     = token_index:uint16, kind:byte │
│                               value:uint16, flags:byte       │
│ rANS Bitstream (M bytes)                                      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Metadata kinds include (but are not limited to):

- `0x00`: Literal span metadata (value = length)
- `0x01`: Dictionary/template identifier (value = template ID)
- `0x02`: LZ match descriptor (value encodes distance/length summary)
- `0x03`: Semantic tags (intent, safety classification)
- `0x04`: Fallback indicators

### 3. Template Layer

#### 3.1 Templates

Templates capture frequently used AI responses. Each template is a string with numbered placeholders. Slots are encoded with 2-byte length prefixes followed by UTF-8 data. Templates are version-controlled and synced to clients at startup. Example:

```
Template  12: "I don't have access to {0}. {1}"
Template  45: "To {0}, use {1}: `{2}`"
Template 120: "Yes, I can help with that. What specific {0} would you like to know more about?"
```

Matching the template yields `DictionaryToken(template_id)` and metadata `(kind=0x01, value=template_id)`.

#### 3.2 Dictionary Snippets

A curated dictionary of short substrings (“Please check”, “I recommend”, “Error:”, etc.) augments templates. Each snippet has an ID ≤255 and primes the LZ window for subsequent matches.

### 4. LZ77 Subsystem

Remaining text is chunked (≤64 bytes) and tokenised using a 32 KiB sliding window. Tokens include `LiteralToken(byte)` and `MatchToken(distance,length)` (distance and length limitations avoid degeneracy). Metadata entries record literal spans and match summaries. If matches would produce little benefit, the encoder emits literals and metadata notes the skipped match.

### 5. rANS Entropy Coding

1. Serialise tokens into bytes (tag + payload).  
2. Build frequency counts with smoothing.  
3. Normalise counts to 2¹², adjusting to keep the sum exact.  
4. Encode bytes in reverse using rANS; flush remaining state bytes.  
5. Decoder reconstructs using stored frequencies/lookup tables.  

This stage yields high compression even when template matches are sparse.

### 6. Metadata Fast-Path

Downstream systems leverage metadata for:

- **Routing** – Template ID + slots direct requests to cached responses without decoding.
- **Policy Enforcement** – Safety metadata triggers moderation or escalation workflows before plaintext inspection.
- **Analytics** – Counting metadata events enables usage tracking without decompressing logs.  

Metadata is optional—systems lacking support may ignore it without affecting decompression.

### 7. Audit Enforcement & Fallback

Servers adhere to a strict pipeline:

1. Decompress payload → plaintext.  
2. Validate tokens/metadata (counts, dictionary IDs, match windows).  
3. Log plaintext, encoded payload, metadata to immutable storage.  
4. Forward plaintext to business logic (or metadata to fast-path handlers).  
5. On validation failure, mark the incident, log plaintext, and re-encode using the fallback compressor (Brotli).  

This guarantees human-readable logs and regulatory compliance.

### 8. Template Discovery & Promotion

#### 8.1 Statistical Algorithms

- **N-gram Mining** – Sliding windows over audit transcripts identify high-frequency substrings.  
- **Clustering** – Edit-distance or embedding-based clustering extracts structural similarities.  
- **Regex Inference** – Heuristics surface repetitive patterns (“I cannot X because Y”).  
- **Prefix/Suffix Extraction** – Finds repeated intros/outros for dictionary additions.

#### 8.2 Promotion Pipeline

Candidates move through evaluation gates: compression advantage, slot stability, safety policy approval, runtime hit rate. Approved templates are versioned and shipped to clients; metadata logs note promotion events for traceability.

### 9. Streaming Harness & Benchmarking

The integration harness launches repeated, staggered human-to-AI and AI-to-AI conversations. Latency and CPU readings are captured for:

- Full decode (plaintext path).  
- Metadata-only processing (fast path).  
- Brotli baseline.  

Results demonstrate ~70% of messages bypass full decompression, reducing CPU while maintaining compliance.

### 10. Implementation Highlights

- Feature flags enable gradual rollout (e.g., `ENABLE_AURA_HYBRID`, `ENABLE_AURA_METADATA_FASTPATH`).
- `ProductionHybridCompressor` chooses between template binary, Brotli fallback, or AURA multi-layer encoding.
- Metadata preserved in audit logs for debugging and analytics.
- Benchmark script (`scripts/benchmark_brio.py`) compares encode/decode costs and metadata overhead.

### 11. Appendices

- **Appendix A**: Core code listing (templates, compressor, experimental modules).  
- **Appendix B**: Benchmark outputs for Brotli vs AURA (CPU time, payload sizes, metadata counts).  
- **Appendix C**: Template dictionary reference.  
- **Appendix D**: Discovery logs documenting auto-promoted templates.  

### 12. Example Workflows

#### 12.1 Human-Assisted Chat

1. User asks “What’s the weather in NYC right now?”  
2. Client identifies dictionary phrases, LZ matches, runs rANS, emits metadata describing the structure.  
3. Server decodes, logs plaintext + metadata, uses metadata to route to weather cache.  
4. Response uses template `To {0}, use {1}: `{2}``, slots recorded in metadata.  

#### 12.2 AI-Agent Function Call

1. Orchestrator issues `execute_task({...})`.  
2. High redundancy yields template and match tokens; metadata encodes function ID and arguments.  
3. Audit log stores plaintext; orchestration layer reads metadata without full decoding to dispatch.

## CLAIMS

### Independent Claims

1. **Hybrid Compression with Metadata** – A method of compressing machine-generated communications comprising: identifying response templates and dictionary phrases; tokenising residual text via sliding-window back references; entropy-encoding the tokens; and emitting, alongside the lossless payload, metadata tuples describing the token stream such that downstream consumers may interpret the structure without reconstructing the plaintext.

2. **Audit-Enforced Server Architecture** – A system architecture enforcing that each received compressed payload is decompressed to plaintext prior to business logic execution; recording plaintext, compressed payload, and metadata to immutable audit storage; and providing automatic fallback to plaintext transmission when validation fails.

3. **Adaptive Template Discovery** – A method of automatically deriving compression templates from historical audit logs using multiple statistical algorithms (n-gram mining, edit-distance clustering, regex inference, prefix/suffix extraction), promoting candidates only when compression advantage, safety, and consistency criteria are satisfied, and synchronising the template library across clients and servers.

4. **AI-to-AI Compression Optimization** – A compression method optimised for AI-to-AI communications wherein structured messages (function calls, status updates, agent directives) are encoded using templates, dictionary tokens, LZ matches, and metadata, achieving higher compression ratios than human-to-AI traffic while preserving auditability.
