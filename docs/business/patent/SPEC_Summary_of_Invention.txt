BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention introduces a multi-stage compression and telemetry framework designated as "AURA" (Adaptive Universal Response Audit). The core technical advances comprise:

Dual-Layer Semantic Encoding: Incoming text is scanned for known response templates and dictionary phrases. Matches are replaced with compact identifiers and slots. Literal spans are tokenized via a rolling-window LZ77 encoder.

rANS Entropy Stage: Serialized tokens are compressed with an order-0 rANS coder using per-payload frequency tables, yielding high compression ratios while keeping decoding deterministic and stateless.

Metadata Side-Channel: Alongside the bitstream, the encoder emits concise metadata tuples describing token index, kind, and value. Downstream services can read template identifiers, slot placements, literal spans, and match distances without reconstructing the full text.

Guaranteed Auditability: The container carries a magic header, version identifier, length fields, frequency tables, and metadata. The decoder can always rebuild the exact UTF-8 message; audit logs remain human-readable by design.

Selective Fallback and Compliance Guardrails: If AURA validation fails due to missing dictionary entry, truncated match, or metadata mismatch, the system automatically falls back to plaintext logging and Brotli compression. The architecture enforces decompression before processing, ensuring audit logs are canonical.

Traffic-Adaptive Template Discovery: An ingestion pipeline replays audit logs through statistical discovery engines including n-gram mining, clustering, regex inference, and prefix/suffix analysis. Candidate templates are promoted only when confidence, compression advantage, and safety thresholds are met, then persisted for future sessions.

Streaming Concurrency Controller: A staged harness staggers the start times of concurrent conversations and AI-to-AI streams, measuring latency and CPU utilization with and without metadata-aware fast paths.

No-Worse Guarantee: Every block carries an uncompressed flag; if AURA fails to beat the original byte count, the system transmits the raw text. Therefore, bandwidth never regresses compared to the source payload, preserving service level agreements.
